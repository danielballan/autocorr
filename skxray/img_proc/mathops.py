"""
This module is designed to facilitate image arithmetic and logical operations
on image data sets. The included functions supplement the logical operations
currently provided in numpy in order to provide a complete set of logical
operations for data analysis.

    This function enables the computation of the LOGICAL_NAND of two image or

    comparison, material isolation, noise removal, or mask
    application/generation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1, x2 : array_like
        Input arrays. `x1` and `x2` must be of the same shape.

    Returns
    -------
    output : {ndarray, bool}
        Boolean result with the same shape as `x1` and `x2` of the logical
        NAND operation on corresponding elements of `x1` and `x2`.


    Example
    -------
    >>> x1 = [[0,0,1,0,0], [2,1,1,1,2], [2,0,1,0,2]]

    NOT INCLUDED IN EITHER OF THE SOURCE DATA SETS. This function can be used
    for data comparison, material isolation, noise removal, or mask

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1, x2 : array_like
        Input arrays. `x1` and `x2` must be of the same shape.

    Returns
    -------
    output : {ndarray, bool}
        Boolean result with the same shape as `x1` and `x2` of the logical
        NOR operation on corresponding elements of `x1` and `x2`.

def logical_sub(x1, x2):
    """Compute truth value of x1 AND (NOT (x1 AND x2)) element wise.

    This function enables LOGICAL SUBTRACTION of one binary image or volume data
    set from another. This function can be used to remove phase information,
    interface boundaries, or noise, present in two data sets, without having to
    worry about mislabeling of pixels which would result from arithmetic
    subtraction. This function will evaluate as true for all "true" voxels
    present ONLY in Source Dataset 1. This function can be used for data
    cleanup, or boundary/interface analysis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1, x2 : array_like
        Input arrays. `x1` and `x2` must be of the same shape.

    Returns
    -------
    output : {ndarray, bool}
        Boolean result with the same shape as `x1` and `x2` of the logical
        SUBTRACT operation on corresponding elements of `x1` and `x2`.
