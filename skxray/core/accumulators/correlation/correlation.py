    """Generator implementation of 1-time multi-tau correlation

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_levels : int
        how many generations of downsampling to perform, i.e., the depth of
        the binomial tree of averaged frames
    num_bufs : int, must be even
        maximum lag step to compute in each generation of downsampling
    labels : array
        Labeled array of the same shape as the image stack.
        Each ROI is represented by sequential integers starting at one.  For
        example, if you have four ROIs, they must be labeled 1, 2, 3,
        4. Background is labeled as 0
    labels : array
        Labeled array of the same shape as the image stack.
        Each ROI is represented by sequential integers starting at one.  For
        example, if you have four ROIs, they must be labeled 1, 2, 3,
        4. Background is labeled as 0
    images : iterable of 2D arrays
    _processing_func : function, optional
        The processing function for the internals of the lazy correlator.
        Defaults to skxray.core.correlation.pyprocess._process
    _state : namedtuple, optional
        _state is a bucket for all of the internal state of the generator.
        It is part of the `results` object that is yielded from this
        generator

    Yields
    ------
    state : namedtuple
        A 'results' object that contains:
        - the normalized correlation, `g2`
        - the times at which the correlation was computed, `lag_steps`
        - and all of the internal state, `final_state`, which is a
          `correlation_state` namedtuple

    Notes
    -----

    The normalized intensity-intensity time-autocorrelation function
    is defined as

    :math ::
        g_2(q, t') = \frac{<I(q, t)I(q, t + t')> }{<I(q, t)>^2}

    ; t' > 0

    Here, I(q, t) refers to the scattering strength at the momentum
    transfer vector q in reciprocal space at time t, and the brackets
    <...> refer to averages over time t. The quantity t' denotes the
    delay time

    This implementation is based on published work. [1]_
